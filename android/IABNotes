1. Create a new IABHelper
2. Run startSetup - this gets passed a OnIabSetupFinishedListener
3. The OnIabSetupFinishedListener queries the inventory passsing a mGotInventoryListener
4. The mGotInventoryListener gets an Inventory object and does a bunch of queries to establish what has been bought.
5. For some reason mGotInventoryListener runs an updateUI()??
6. Now we have explicit handlers for buying specific things.
7. Let's go through onBuyGasButtonClicked
8. The purchase is made through mHelperlaunchPurchaseFlow(context, SKU, requestCode ,mPurchaseFinishedListener, payload)
9. The listener checks for the current purchase.
10. I need to follow gas - it is the closest thing to hints.
11. MHelpher has some function called mHelper.consumeAsync - this consumes the product - in our case hints.
