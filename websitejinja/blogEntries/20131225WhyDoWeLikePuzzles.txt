Why Do We Like Puzzles?

Why do we like puzzles? Life is hard enough with out without someone deliberately obscuring information for us to attempt to decipher! The IRS has been issuing an annual puzzle called "the 1040 tax form" for years, but no one seems to find that fun. Teachers assign challenging homework but again we are not thrilled. So why do we like puzzles?

I want to offer some thoughts on this age old question in the context of our new game Bee-Line. I promise that talking about Bee-Line is NOT shameless self promotion. I do, in fact, feel a healthy measure of shame :)

I believe we like puzzles because we can understand them. The goal is transparent, the means are supplied, and it is simply up to us to uncover the steps leading to a solution. The real world problem, however, almost never gives us a clear goal nor does it supply a simple toolbox to work with. This is just one of the many reasons that real life completely sucks. Puzzles, in contrast, give us direction and tools to progress and what is left is the pleasure of pure deduction.

A puzzle with a clear goal and simple toolbox is, therefor, best. With Bee-Line, we worked insanely hard to make simple the goal and toolbox. But in doing this we had to take care not to oversimplify the puzzle. And, indeed, Bee-Line can be a very hard puzzle but because the goal and toolbox are both simple, players at least understand it. And I think this is why puzzles like Bee-Line are fun: We may be confused, but at least we know our goal and precisely what we are stuck on.

Next time you get stuck on a puzzle, ask yourself: "Do I at least know what I am trying to do?" If the answer is "no", the puzzle has failed to make itself transparent to you (or you didn't have enough coffee that morning). If the answer is "yes", the puzzle has succeeded and you may start to feel that nagging urge to snatch up your mobile device and give in to those early symptoms of a new addiction.
