          <h3>History</h3>
	</div>
	<p>The concept for the puzzle dates back to the summer of 2012 where Leland J. Jefferis (one of the founders of Seventh Harmonic LLC) spent his days in a cubical in Shanghai making up a number puzzle simply to amuse himself.  This puzzle became known as "The Rooks Walk". The puzzle is "featured" on his home page with daily updates.  The site attracts up to one viewer every single day (Leland) and was a hit (with Leland). When Lalit K. Jain (another founder) came upon the idea of Android-ifying the puzzle, a rapid development process ensued where in the puzzle evolved to its current form. This process involved (and still involves) three chai lattes per day and fierce dedication to learning the Android platform from the bottom up! It's been fun! Keep up with the goings on by vising the blog where you will find all kinds of rants and raves surrounding the trials and triumphs of creating Bee-Line.</p>
