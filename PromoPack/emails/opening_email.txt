Dear X,

I am writing in order to request a review for our new puzzle app, Bee-Line.

LINK

Bee-Line, an elegant new puzzle game created by three math grad students. Sometimes described as a mash-up of a maze and a Sudoku, Bee-Line offers an original concept, gorgeous hand drawn art, and a smooth user interface.

We launched Bee-Line N days ago and already have around M downloads! We are looking to widen our audience and really feel that a review from X would benefit us greatly.

We feel Bee-Line will be great addition to your archives and we look forward to your response.

Sincerely,

Bee-Line Dev Team at Seventh Harmonic LLC.
