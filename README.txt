Running the code:

1.) To compile the cpp, type make inside of the cpp directory. You may need to modify the CPP var inside the makefile for your specific compiler.

2.) To compile the android project (assuming you already have the android SDK configured), simply type ``ant debug'' inside of the android folder as you would with any other android project. Currently, anroid NDK is not requried since the cpp work is unrealted to the android stuff at the moment.
